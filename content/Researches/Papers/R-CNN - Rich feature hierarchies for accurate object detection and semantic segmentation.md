# Idea
Convert detection problem to classification problem
# Architecture

## Region Proposals
Usually generated by **selective search**
## Feature Extraction
Before warping, the region size is expanded to a new size that will result in $16$ pixels of context in the warped frame. The [[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)|CNN]] used is AlexNet and it is typically fine-tuned on a large dataset like ImageNet for generic feature representation.

## Object Classification
The extracted feature vectors from the region proposals are fed into a separate machine learning classifier for each object class of interest. R-CNN typically uses **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for classification. For each class, a unique SVM is trained to determine whether or not the region proposal contains an instance of that class.
