# Ideas
## Atrous Convolution (Dilated Convolution)
Allowing the model to capture features at multiple scales without downsampling the feature maps, which is crucial for maintaining spatial resolution.

By adjusting the dilation rate, the network can expand its receptive field while keeping the number of parameters manageable.
