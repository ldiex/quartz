# Idea
## Local Attention
Attention mechanism implemented through convolutional layers, which operate on small patches of the input (e.g., $3\times3$ or $5\times5$ kernels)
## Non-local Attention
Extends the concept of attention by allowing the model to consider relationships across the entire input space, regardless of distance.
# Method
See [[PSANet - Point-wise Spatial Attention Network for Scene Parsing]]
