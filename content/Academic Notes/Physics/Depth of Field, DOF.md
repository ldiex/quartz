*Depth of field* refers to **the range of distances** in front of and behind the subject that **appear acceptably sharp** in the image

Factors that affect depth of field include
- **Aperture size** - A wider aperture (smaller f-number) results in a shallower depth of field, while a narrower aperture (larger f-number) increases depth of field
- **Focal length** - Longer focal lengths produce a shallower depth of field compared to shorter focal lengths
- **Distance to subject** - As the distance to the subject increases, the depth of field also increases
