  
*Grid world* is a simple environment often used in the field of artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning for testing and developing algorithms. **It consists of a grid of cells, where each cell represents a state in the environment. Agents can move around the grid and interact with the environment according to certain rules.**

Typically, the grid world environment includes features such as *walls*, *obstacles*, *rewards*, and *possibly hazards*. The goal of an agent in a grid world environment is often to navigate from a starting position to a goal position while avoiding obstacles and maximizing rewards.

Examples:

1. Cliff Walking
2. Maze Navigation
3. Frozen Lake
