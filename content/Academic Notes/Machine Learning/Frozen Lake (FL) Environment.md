*The Frozen Lake environment* is a part of the [[OpenAI Gym toolkit]], designed for reinforcement learning tasks. 

In this environment, the player **navigates a frozen lake grid world from a starting point to a goal while avoiding holes that lead to failure.** The game involves moving in a slippery environment **where the player may not always move in the intended direction due to the icy surface**. **The player's objective is to reach the goal without falling into any holes**, with rewards typically set at +1.0 for reaching the goal, -0.2 for agent death, and -0.01 for reaching a non-goal frozen spot

The Frozen Lake environment can be customized with different configurations, including pre-determined maps, random maps, and custom maps, allowing for variations in gameplay and challenges
