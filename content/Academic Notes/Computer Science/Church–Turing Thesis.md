The *Churchâ€“Turing thesis* (also *known as computability thesis*) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that **a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a [[Turing Machine|Turing machine]].**

In particular, the *computability* of a Turing machine is identical to a [[von Neumann Architecture|von Neumann computer]] with sufficiently large memory.
