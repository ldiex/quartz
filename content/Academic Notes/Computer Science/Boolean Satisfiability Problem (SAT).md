# Definition
A [[propositional logic]] *formula*, also called *Boolean expression*, is built from variables, operators AND, OR, NOT, and parentheses. 

A *formula* is said to be *satisfiable* if it can be made TRUE by assigning appropriate logical values (i.e. TRUE, FALSE) to its variables. 

The *Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT)* is, **given a formula, to check whether it is satisfiable.** 

# Complexity
