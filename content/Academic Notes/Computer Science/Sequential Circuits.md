*Sequential circuits* are [[Circuits (Computer Science)|circuits]] that store and use previous state information to determine their next state. Unlike [[Combinational Circuits|combinational circuits]], which only depend on current inputs, sequential circuits rely on both current inputs and the previous state stored in memory elements, typically implemented using [[Flip-flop|flip-flops]]

There are two main types of sequential circuits:
1. *Asynchronous sequential circuits*: These do not use clock signals and respond immediately to input changes. They are faster but more challenging to design

2. *Synchronous sequential circuits*: These use clock signals to synchronize state changes. They are more common and easier to design, though slightly slower than asynchronous circuits
