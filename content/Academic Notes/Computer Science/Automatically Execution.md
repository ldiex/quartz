# What's Automatically Execution in Computer Science
Computer science targets those bodies of knowledge (whether they are theory, hardware, or software) which enable computational processes to be automatically executed on computers. That is why computer science emphasizes exact, step-by-step processes. **Only such processes can be understood by computers, thus amiable to mechanic, step-by-step automatic execution.** Even for human-in-the-loop processes, computational thinking will try to make them largely automatic and seamless.
# Nordhaus W D. Two Centuries of Productivity Growth in Computing
> The present study analyzes computer performance over the last century and a half. Three results stand out. First, there has been a phenomenal increase in computer power over the twentieth century. Depending upon the standard used, computer performance has improved since manual computing by a factor between 1.7 trillion and 76 trillion. Second, there was a major break in the trend around World War II. Third, this study develops estimates of the growth in computer power relying on performance rather than components; the price declines using performance-based measures are markedly larger than those reported in the official statistics.
