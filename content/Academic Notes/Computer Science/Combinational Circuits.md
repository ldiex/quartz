A *combinational circuit* in computer science is a type of digital logic [[Circuits (Computer Science)|circuit]] whose output is determined **solely by the current combination of its inputs, without any memory or feedback from previous states.** This means that the output of a combinational circuit is a direct function of the present input values and does not depend on any past inputs or states.

Combinational circuits **do not store any state information**. The output is purely based on the current inputs. These circuits are constructed using [[Logic Gate|logic gates]] such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.
 
Combinational circuits are often fast and **suitable for real-time applications** since the output is generated almost instantaneously as the inputs change.

Combinational circuits perform operations that can be described by [[Boolean Logic|Boolean logic]], which involves binary variables and logical operations, so the circuit itself can be seen as a [[Boolean Function|Boolean function]]
