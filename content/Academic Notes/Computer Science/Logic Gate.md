*Logic gates* are fundamental building blocks of digital circuits and systems in computer science and electronics. They perform basic logical operations on binary inputs to produce a single binary output. 

Logic gates work with binary inputs and outputs, typically represented as 0 (low) or 1 (high). Therefore, they implement [[Boolean Logic|Boolean logic]] operations, allowing for complex logical computations.

Most logic gates have two or more inputs but only one output, and the output is determined **solely by the current input combination**, with no memory of previous states.

Basic types of logic gates:

1. **AND Gate**: Outputs 1 only if all inputs are 1

2. **OR Gate**: Outputs 1 if at least one input is 1

3. **NOT Gate** (*Inverter*): Outputs the opposite of its single input

4. **NAND Gate**: Combination of AND and NOT gates

5. **NOR Gate**: Combination of OR and NOT gates

6. **XOR Gate**: Outputs 1 if inputs are different

7. **XNOR Gate**: Outputs 1 if inputs are the same

Logic gates are represented by specific symbols in [[Circuits (Computer Science) |circuits]] diagrams and can be combined to create more complex logical functions and circuits
