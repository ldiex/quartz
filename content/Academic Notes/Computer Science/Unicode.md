*Unicode*, formally *The Unicode Standard*, is a text encoding standard maintained by the Unicode Consortium designed to support the use of text in all of the world's writing systems that can be digitized.

The Unicode Standard defines a *codespace*: a sequence of integers called *code points* in the range from $0$ to $1114111$, notated according to the standard as `U+0000`–`U+10FFFF`.The codespace is a systematic, architecture-independent representation of The Unicode Standard; actual text is processed as binary data via one of several Unicode encodings, such as [[UTF-8]]

In this normative notation, the two-character prefix `U+` always precedes a written code point, and the code points themselves are written as hexadecimal numbers. At least four hexadecimal digits are always written, **with leading zeros prepended as needed**. For example, the code point `U+00F7` which represents the division sign `÷` is padded with two leading zeros.

There are a total of $220 + (216 − 211) = 1112064$ valid code points within the codespace.
