A *pointer* is a variable that **stores** the [[Memory Address|memory address]] of another variable as its value.

A *pointer variable* **points** to a **data type** (like `int`) of the same type, whose address could be attained by `&` operator.

To get the value of the variable the pointer points, use the `*` operator (the *dereference* operator)
