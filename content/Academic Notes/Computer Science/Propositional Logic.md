*Propositional logic*, also known as *propositional calculus*, is a branch of logic that deals with propositions, which are statements that can either be *true* or *false*. It uses logical connectives such as AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, and EQUIVALENT to form more complex statements from simpler ones.

The primary concern in propositional logic is the **truth value of these propositions** and **how they can be combined and manipulated to form valid logical arguments and proofs**

The most powerful tool to deal with propositional logic is [[Boolean Logic|Boolean logic]]
