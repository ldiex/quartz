The *von Neumann architecture* is a computer architecture based on a 1945 description by *John von Neumann*, which includes

- A processing unit with both an *arithmetic logic* unit and *processor registers*
- A *control unit* that includes an instruction register and a program counter
- *Memory* that stores data and instructions
- External mass storage
- Input and output mechanisms

von Neumann architecture has the following characteristics
- Use binary format to represent [[Data Representation|data]] and programs
- Have three main components *P-M-I/O*, that is, processor, memory and I/O devices
- It's a *stored program computer*, which can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation.
- It's instruction driven, and a *instruction set* (see [[Assembly Language (ASM)#Basic Instructions|the basic instructions in ASM]]) is designed to define what the processor can do
- Sequential execution. The instructions are executed one by one, and only one can be tackled in the meantime
