In computer programming, an *indirection* (also called a *reference*) is a way of **referring to something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself.** 

The most common form of indirection is the act of manipulating a value through its [[Memory Address|memory address]]. For example, accessing a variable through the use of a [[Pointer|pointer]]. A stored pointer that exists to provide a reference to an object by double indirection is called an indirection node.

Another example of indirection is [[Unicode]], which serves as a bridge between specific characteristics and binary data encodings such as [[UTF-8]]
