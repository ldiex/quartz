In computing, a *memory address* is a reference to a specific memory location used at various levels by software and hardware in [[von Neumann Architecture]]. Memory addresses are fixed-length sequences of digits conventionally displayed and manipulated as unsigned integers. Such numerical semantic bases itself upon features of CPU (such as the *instruction pointer* and *incremental address registers*), as well upon use of the memory like an *array* endorsed by various [[Computer Science#Programming Languages|programming languages]].
