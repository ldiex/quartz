Also known as *Wheeler's indirection theorem*, the theorem says that **any problem in computer science can be solved with another level of [[Indirection|indirection]]**

The theorem does not describe an actual theorem that can be proven; rather, it is a general principle for managing [[Computational Complexity|complexity]] through [[Abstraction|abstraction]].
