An *algorithm* is a finite set of rules specifying sequences of computational steps for solving a given problem, with the following five properties.
- **Finiteness**. An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.
- **Definiteness**. Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined, that is, the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified.
- **Input**. An algorithm has zero or more inputs, given before the algorithm begins or during the algorithm's execution.
- **Output**. An algorithm has one or more outputs, which relate to the inputs.
- **Effectiveness**. Every operation of an algorithm must be sufficiently rudimentary, such that in principle, the operation can be done by a human using paper and pencil, **in finite time**.
