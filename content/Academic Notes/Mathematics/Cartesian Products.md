# Ordered $n$-tuple
The *ordered $n$-tuple* $(a_1,a_2, \ldots ,a_n)$ is the ordered collection that has $a_1$ as its first element, $a_2$ as its second element, ... , and $a_n$ as its $n$-th element

In particular, ordered $2$-tuples are called *ordered pairs*. 
# Cartesian Product
Let $A$ and $B$ be [[Set|sets]]. The *Cartesian product* of $A$ and $B$, denoted by $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$, where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$. Hence
$$
A \times B = \left\{ (a,b) \mid a\in A \land b\in B \right\} 
$$
The *Cartesian product* of the sets $A_1,A_2, \ldots ,A_n$, denoted by $A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n$ is the set of ordered $n$-tuples $(a_1,a_2, \ldots ,a_n)$, where $a_i$ belongs to $A_i$ for $i = 1,2, \ldots ,n$. In other words
$$
A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_n = \left\{ (a_1,a_2, \ldots ,a_n) \mid a_i\in A_i \text{ for } i = 1,2, \ldots ,n \right\} 
$$

# Relation
A **subset** $R$ of the Cartesian Product $A \times B$ is called a *relation* from set $A$ to the set $B$. A relation from $A$ to itself is called a relation *on* $A$
