A *cover* of a set $X$ is a family of subsets of $X$ whose union is all of $X$. More formally, if $C = \left\{ U_\alpha : \alpha\in A \right\}$ is an [[Indexed Family|indexed family]] of subsets $U_\alpha\in X$ (indexed by the set $A$), then $C$ is a cover of $X$ if $X \subset \bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_\alpha$
