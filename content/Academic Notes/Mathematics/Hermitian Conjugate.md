We call the matrix with complex elements as *complex matrix*. Similar to *matrix transpose*, we can define a *Hermitian conjugate* operation, that is, **transpose a matrix and then take complex conjugation for each matrix element**
$$
A^\dagger_{ij} = A_{ji}^* = \overline{A_{ji}}
$$
(for any $c\in \mathbb{C}$, $c^*$ or $\bar{c}$ stand for the [[Complex Numbers#共轭|conjugation]] of $c$)

Note that **when the matrix elements are all real**, the Hermitian conjugation is consistent to matrix transpose.  

$𝐴^\dagger$ Also known as the *adjoint matrix* (do not confuse it with [[Adjugate Matrix|adjugate matrix]])
