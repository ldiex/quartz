# Group
A *group* is a non-empty set $G$ together with a binary operation on $G$, denoted as "$\cdot$", such that the following three requirements are satisfied

**Associativity**
For all $a, b, c \in G$, one has $(a\cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$

**Identity element**
There exists an *identity element* $e$ in $G$ such that, for every $a$ in $G$, one has $e \cdot a = a, \; a \cdot e = a$

**Inverse element**
For each $a$ in $G$, there exists an element $b$ in $G$ such that $a \cdot b = e$ and $b \cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element. $b$ is denoted as $a^{-1}$

## Subgroup
Given a group $G$ under a binary operation $∗$, a subset $H$ of $G$ is called a *subgroup* of $G$ if $H$ also forms a *group* under the operation $∗$. More precisely, $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if the restriction of $∗$ to $H × H$ is a group operation on $H$. This is often denoted $H ≤ G$, read as "$H$ is a subgroup of $G$".
