In computer science and discrete mathematics, an *inversion* in a sequence is a pair of elements that are out of their natural order.

Let $\pi$ be a [[Permutation|permutation]]. There is an inversion of $\pi$ between $i$ and $j$ if $i < j$ and $\pi(i) > \pi(j)$. The inversion is indicated by an ordered pair containing either the places $(i,j)$ or the elements $(\pi(i), \pi(j))$
