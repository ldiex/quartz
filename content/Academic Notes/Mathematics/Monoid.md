A *monoid* is a non-empty set $S$ together with a binary operation on $S$, denoted as "$\cdot$", such that the following two requirements are satisfied

**Associativity**
For all $a, b, c \in S$, one has $(a\cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$

**Identity element**
There exists an *identity element* $e$ in $S$ such that, for every $a$ in $S$, one has $e \cdot a = a, \; a \cdot e = a$
