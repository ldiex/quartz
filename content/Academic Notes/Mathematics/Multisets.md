A *multiset* is an unordered collection of elements where an element can occur as a member more than once. We can use the same notation for a multiset as we do for a [[Set|set]], but each element is listed the number of times it occurs.

So, the multiset denoted by $\left\{ a,a,a,b,b \right\}$ is the multiset that contains the element $a$ thrice and $b$ twice. There is another notation $\left\{ m_1\cdot a_1,m_2\cdot a_2, \ldots ,m_r\cdot a_r \right\}$ denotes the multiset with $a_i$ occurs $m_i$ times.

The numbers $m_i$ are called the *multiplicities* of the elements $a_i$. (Elements not in a multiset are assigned $0$ as their multiplicities in this set)
