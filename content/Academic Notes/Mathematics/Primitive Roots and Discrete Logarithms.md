A *primitive root* module a prime $p$ is an integer $r$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ such that every non-zero element of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a power of $r$.

We can say here $r$ can generate the space of $\mathbb{Z}_p$

An important fact is that there is a primitive root module $p$ for every prime $p$. Suppose this primitive root is $r$, and $a$ is an integer between $1$ and $p-1$ inclusive. If $r^e \operatorname{mod} p = a$ and $0 \leq e \leq p-1$, we say that $e$ is the *discrete logarithm* of $a$ module $p$ to the base $r$ and we write $\log_ra =e$
