# Predicates
Statements involving variables, such as $x > 3$ or "Computer $x$ is functioning properly" are neither true nor false when the values of the variables are not specified. In this section, we discuss the way that [[Propositional Logic#Propositions|propositions]] can be **produced** from such statements

The statement "$x$ is greater than $3$" has two parts: the first part is the *variable* $x$ and the second part - the *predicate* - refers to a property that the subject of the statement can have. We can denote the statement "$x$ is greater than $3$" by $P(x)$
