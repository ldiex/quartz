*Stirling's approximation* (or *Stirling's formula*) is an asymptotic approximation for *factorials*, or [[Euler Integral#Gamma函数|Gamma function]]

One way of stating the approximation involves the logarithm of the factorial
$$
\ln (n!) = n\ln n - n + O(\ln n)
$$
where $O(\cdot)$ is [[Time Complexity#Big $O$| the big O notation]]

An approximate formula for the factorial itself is that
$$
n! \sim \sqrt{ 2\pi n } \left( \dfrac{n}{e} \right)^n 
$$
This formula leads to accurate results even for small values $n$
