The Gamma distribution is a generalization of the [[Exponential Distribution]]. While an Exponential [[Continuous Random Variables|r.v.]] represents the waiting time for the first success under conditions of memoryless-ness, we shall see that Gamma r.v. represents the total waiting time for multiple successes

An r.v. $Y$ is said to have the *Gamma Distribution* with parameters $a$ and $\lambda$, where $a > 0$ and $\lambda > 0$, if its [[Continuous Random Variables#Probability Density Function|PDF]] is
$$
f(y) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(a)}(\lambda y)^a e^{-\lambda y} \frac{1}{y}, \quad y>0
$$
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the [[Euler Integral#Gamma函数|Gamma Function]]. And we write $Y \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(a,\lambda)$
