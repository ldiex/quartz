A set of points in a $d$-dimensional [[Affine Space]] ($d$-dimensional [[Euclidean Space]] is a common example) is in *general linear position* (or just *general position*) if no $k$ of them lie in a $(k − 2)$-dimensional flat for $k = 2, 3, ..., d + 1$. These conditions contain considerable redundancy since, if the condition holds for some value $k_0$ then it also must hold for all $k$ with $2 ≤ k ≤ k_0$. Thus, for a set containing at least $d + 1$ points in $d$-dimensional affine space to be in general position, it suffices that no [[Hyperplane]] contains more than $d$ points – i.e. the points do not satisfy any more linear relations than they must.
