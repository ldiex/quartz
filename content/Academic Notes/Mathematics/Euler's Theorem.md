*Euler's theorem* is a generalization of [[Fermat's Little Theorem|Fermat's little theorem]] dealing with powers of integers modulo positive integers. It arises in applications of elementary number theory, including the theoretical underpinning for the [[RSA Encryption|RSA]] cryptosystem.

Euler's theorem says, if $n$ is a positive integer, and let $a$ be an integer that is relatively prime to $n$. Then
$$
a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}
$$
where $\phi(n)$ is [[Euler's Totient Function|Euler's totient function]], which counts the number of positive integers less than $n$ that is also relative prime to $n$
