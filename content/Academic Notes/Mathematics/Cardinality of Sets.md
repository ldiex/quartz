# Definition
The sets $A$ and $B$ have the same *cardinality* if and only if there is one-to-one correspondence from $A$ to $B$. When $A$ and $B$ have the same cardinality, we write $\left|A\right| = \left|B\right|$

If there is a one-to-one function from $A$ to $B$, the cardinality of $A$ is less than or the same as the cardinality of $B$ and we write $\left|A\right| \leq \left|B\right|$.
# Countable Sets
A set that is either finite or has the same cardinality as the set of positive integers is called *countable*. A set that is not countable is called *uncountable*. When an **infinite** set $S$ is countable, we denote the cardinality of $S$ by $\aleph_0$. We write $\left|S\right|= \aleph_0$ and say that $S$ has cardinality "aleph null"

If $A$ and $B$ are countable sets, then $A \cup B$ is also countable.

If $A$ and $B$ are sets with $\left|A\right|\leq \left|B\right|$ and $\left|B\right|\leq \left|A\right|$, then $\left|A\right|= \left|B\right|$

# The Continuum Hypothesis
Cantor states that the cardinality of a set is always less than the cardinality of its [[Power Sets|power set]]. Hence, $\left|\mathbb{Z}^+\right| < \left|\mathcal P(\mathbb{Z}^+)\right|$. We can rewrite this as $\aleph_0 < 2^{\aleph_0}$. We denote $2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_1$

We have $\left|\mathbb{R}\right| = \aleph_1$

The continuum hypothesis is that there is no cardinal number $X$ between these numbers:
$$
\aleph_0 <\aleph_1 < \aleph_2< \cdots
$$
where $\aleph_{n+1} = 2^{\aleph_n}$
