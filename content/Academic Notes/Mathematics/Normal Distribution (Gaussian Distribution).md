# Standard Normal Distribution
A [[Continuous Random Variables|continuous r.v.]] $Z$ is said to have the *standard normal distribution* if its [[Continuous Random Variables#Probability Density Function|PDF]] $\varphi$ is given by
$$
\varphi(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi }}e^{-z^{2}/2}, \quad -\infty < z <\infty
$$
We write this as $Z \sim \mathcal N(0,1)$ since, as we could obtain $Z$ has mean $0$ and variance $1$

# Normal Distribution
If $Z \sim \mathcal N(0,1)$, then
$$
X = \mu + \sigma Z
$$
is said to have the *normal distribution* with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$, for any real $\mu$ and $\sigma^{2}$ with $\sigma > 0$. We denote this by $X \sim \mathcal N(\mu, \sigma^{2})$
