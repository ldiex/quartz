A *ring* is a set $R$ equipped with two binary operations, *addition* and *multiplication*, satisfying the following three sets of axioms:
1. $R$ is an [[Abelian Group]] under additon
2. $R$ is a [[Monoid]] under multiplication
3. Multiplication is distributive with respect to additon, meaning that
	- left distributivity: $a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)$ 
	- right distributivity: $(b + c) \cdot  a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a)$
