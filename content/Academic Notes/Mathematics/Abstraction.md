*Abstraction* or *generalization* is a basic tactic in [[Mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Computer Science|computer science]] research. By formulating an argument or placing a concept in ‘proper generality’, one not only strengthens results and widens applicability, but one also perceives much more clearly what is truly at stake within the sphere of concepts where the mathematics takes place.

The key to find the ‘right’ generality of concepts is to neglect the **unnecessary characteristics** of them and delve into the core, underlying structures.
