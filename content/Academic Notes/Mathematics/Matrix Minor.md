A *matrix minor* is the **determinant of a submatrix obtained by deleting one or more rows and/or columns from a given matrix.**  Specifically:
# $k$-th Order Minor
In an $n$-by-$n$ matrix, a $k$-th order minor is the determinant of a $k$-by-$k$ submatrix, where $k$ can be any integer between $1$ and $n$. The $k$ rows and $k$ columns can be any combination, as long as the number of rows and columns are equal.
# Principal Minor
A *principal minor* is a minor where the rows and columns selected have the same row/column indices. For example, selecting the $i_1$th, $i_2$th, ..., $i_k$th rows and columns.
# Leading Principal Minor
A *leading principal minor* is a principal minor where the selected rows and columns have consecutive indices, i.e. the first $k$ rows and columns. The $k$-th leading principal minor of a given matrix is **unique**
