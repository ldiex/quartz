# Idea
*Bayes' theorem* gives a mathematical rule for inverting conditional probabilities, **allowing us to find the probability of a cause given its effect**.
# Theorem
The theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:
$$
P(A\vert B) = \dfrac{P(B \vert A)P(A)}{P(B)}
$$
And can be simply proven from the definition of conditional probability:
$$
P(A \vert B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \quad P(B \vert A) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
$$
