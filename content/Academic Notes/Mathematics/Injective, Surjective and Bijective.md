# Injective (One-to-One)
A linear transformation $A: V \to W$ is said to be injective (or one-to-one) if:

$$\forall u, v \in V, Au = Av \Rightarrow u = v$$

In other words, if two distinct input vectors $u$ and $v$ produce the same output vector, then $A$ is not injective. Injective functions preserve distinctness.

# Surjective (Onto)
A linear transformation $A: V \to W$ is said to be surjective (or onto) if:

$$\forall w \in W, \exists v \in V, Av = w$$

In other words, for every vector $w$ in the codomain $W$, there exists a vector $v$ in the domain $V$ such that $Av = w$. Surjective functions cover the entire codomain.

# Bijective (One-to-One Correspondence)
A linear transformation $A: V \to W$ is said to be *bijective* (or a *one-to-one correspondence*) if **it is both injective and surjective.**

In other words, a bijective function is a perfect matching between the domain and codomain, where every input vector corresponds to a unique output vector, and every output vector has a corresponding input vector.

These definitions are crucial in understanding the properties of linear transformations and their applications in various fields!
