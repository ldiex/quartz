The [[Convolution|convolution]] defines a product on the [[Linear Space|linear space]] of integrable functions. The space of integrable functions with the product given by convolution is a commutative associative algebra without identity. 

# Commutativity
$$
f * g = g * f
$$
# Associativity
$$
f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h
$$
# Distributivity
$$
f * (g  + h) = (f * g) + (f * h)
$$
# Multiplicative Identity
$$
f * \delta = f
$$
where $\delta$ is the [[Dirac Delta Function]]
# Inverse Element
Some function $S$ have an inverse element $S^-1$ for the convolution:
$$
S^{-1} * S = \delta
$$
The set of invertible distributions form an [[Abelian Group]] under convolution
