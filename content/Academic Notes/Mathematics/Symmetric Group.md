The *symmetric group* on a finite set $X$ is the [[Group|group]] whose elements are all [[Injective, Surjective and Bijective|bijective]] functions from $X$ to $ùëã$ and whose group operation is that of function composition. For finite sets, "[[Permutation|permutations]]" and "bijective functions" refer to the same operation, namely **rearrangement**. The symmetric group of degree $n$ is the symmetric group on the set $\left\{ 1,2, \ldots ,n \right\}$, which is often denoted as $S_n$
