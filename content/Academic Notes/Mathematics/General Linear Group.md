In mathematics, the *general linear group* of degree $n$ is the set of $n√ón$ invertible matrices, together with the operation of ordinary matrix multiplication. This forms a *group*, because the product of two invertible matrices is again invertible, and the inverse of an invertible matrix is invertible, **with the identity matrix as the identity element of the group**. 

The group is so named because the columns (and also the rows) of an invertible matrix are linearly independent, hence the vectors/points they define are in [[General Linear Position]], **and matrices in the general linear group take points in general linear position to points in general linear position.**

The notation $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ is a general linear group  of degree $n$ over [[Field]] $F$
