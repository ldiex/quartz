A binary relation $\sim$ on a set $X$ is said to be an *equivalence relation*, if and only if it is *reflexive*, *symmetric* and *transitive*. That is, for all $a, b$ and $c$ in $X$:
- $a \sim a$ (reflexivity)
- $a \sim b \iff b \sim a$ (symmetry)
- $(a \sim b) \land (b \sim c) \implies a \sim c$ (transitivity)
