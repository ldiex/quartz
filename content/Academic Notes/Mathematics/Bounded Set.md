A set is called *bounded* if all of its points are within a certain distance of each other. Conversely, a set which is not bounded is called *unbounded*

For real numbers, a set $S \subset \mathbb{R}$ is *bounded* if there exists $d > 0$ such that for all $x,y\in S$ we have $\left|x - y\right| < d$

This idea could be generalized to [[Metric Space|metric spaces]] $(M,d)$, by replace the $\left|x - y\right|$ above with $d(x,y)$
