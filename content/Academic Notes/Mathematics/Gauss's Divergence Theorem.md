 Suppose $V$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is [[Compact Space|compact]] and has a piece wide smooth boundary $S$ (also indicated with $\delta V = S$). If $\boldsymbol F$ is a continuously [[Differential of Multivariable Functions|differentiable]] vector field defined on a neighborhood of $V$, then
$$
\iiint_V (\nabla\cdot \boldsymbol F) \mathrm{d}V = \iint_S (\boldsymbol F\cdot \boldsymbol {\hat{n}}) \mathrm{d}S
$$
The left side is a [[Multiple Integral#三重积分|volume integral]] over the volume $V$, and the right side is the [[Surface Integral|surface integral]] over the boundary of the volume $V$. The closed, measurable set $\delta V$ is oriented by [[Surface Integral#曲面的侧|outward-pointing normals]]
