*Compactness* is a property that seeks to generalize the notion of a closed and bounded subset of [[Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]]

A subset of Euclidean space in particular is called *compact* if it is closed and [[Bounded Set|bounded]], which implies that any infinite sequence from the set has a [[Subsequence|subsequence]] that converges to a point in the set,

Formally, a [[Topological Space|topological space]] $X$ is called *compact* if every open [[Cover (Topology)|cover]] of $X$ has a finite sub-cover. That is, $X$ is compact if for every collection $C$ of open subsets of $X$ such that $X = \bigcup_{S\in C} S$, there is a finite sub-collection $F \subset C$ such that $\bigcup_{S\in F} S$
