In linear algebra, a *projection* is a linear map $P$ form a vector space to itself (an *endomorphism*) such that $P^2 = P$. 

# Projection matrix
A square matrix $P$ is called a *projection matrix* if it is equal to its square

## Orthogonal Projection
For example, the function which maps the point $(x, y, z)$ in 3-d space to the point $(x, y, 0)$ is an orthogonal projection onto the $xy$-plane, whose matrix:
$$
P = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$
is a projection matrix

## Oblique Projection
Like
$$
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
\alpha & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$
