The *bandit walk (BW)* is a walk with three states, but only one not-terminal state. Environments that have a single non-terminal state are called "bandit" environments. "Bandit" here is an analogy to slot machines, which are also known as "one-armed bandits"; they have one arm and, if you like gambling, can empty your pockets, the same way a bandit would.
